        <h1>Leveling is a Marathon!</h1>

        <p>With that said, leveling will take you a <strong>while</strong> !</p>

        <p>So get comfortable with you character, because you are going to be stuck with it for a while.</p>

        <p>As for leveling spec, i recommend going <strong>Arms</strong>. Stuff like: <em>Tactical Mastery, Anger Managment and <strong>Sweeping Strikes</strong></em> are going to make leveling so much easier.</p>
