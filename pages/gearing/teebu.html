        <h1>Teebu's Blazing Longsword</h1>

        <p>This weapon is one of the best pre-raid Main-hand weapons you can get both for warriors and rogues.</p>

        <p>Combined with amazing base DPS, this weapon has <strong>2.90 weapon speed</strong>,aswell as good on-hit chance proc!</p>

        <p>Extremly slow weapon speed makes it scale very good with Rogue's <em>Sinister Strike</em> skill. But for Warriors slow Main hand means more off hand strikes while <em>Heroic Strike</em> is queued.</p>

        <p>There is one down side to this weapon. And it's that this weapon is random World Drop epic. Which makes it very hard to farm, and can be very expensive.</p>

        <p>In conclusion, if you can get this weapon,great! But I would rather reccomend <a href=./felstriker.html>Felstriker</a> or rather <a href=./rend.html>Dal'Rends</a> duo.</p>
