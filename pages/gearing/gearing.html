        <h1>Warrior 60 gearing guide</h1>

        <p>Warrior gearing once you get 60 is pretty much plain and simple but can be very time consuming.</p>

        <p>While being one of the most powerfull classes in all aspects of Vanilla game, a lot of people are playing warriors, so expect competition in every dungeon and raid while playing a warrior.</p>

        <p>Here are some weapon suggestions i think yous should consider for your char. Please refer to links below.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href=../gearing/rend.html>Dal'Rends Swords Set</a> very powerfull pre-raid swords.</li>
            <li><a href=../gearing/felstriker.html>Felstriker</a> pre raid bis off hand weapon.</li>
            <li><a href=../gearing/teebu.html>Teebu's Blazing Longsword</a> Very good, but very rare weapon.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Getting gear for your Warrior may be rough, boring and time consuming, but it's worth in the end!</p>
